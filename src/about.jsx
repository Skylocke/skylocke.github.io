            <h2>RACHEL IS A FAN OF WHIMSY AND TECHNICAL CHALLENGES</h2>
            <p>Rachel's love of video games and robotics motivates her foray into coding,
              and her engineering background has trained her problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and aversion to error.</p>
            <p>After getting her Bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering and
              working as a structural engineer for a while, Rachel figured it was
              high time she moved on to master the coding world as the next step
              in bringing about the robot apocalpyse in her image.</p>
            <p>Good luck to humanity, y'all!</p>
